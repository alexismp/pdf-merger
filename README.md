# Your own PDF Merger (as a Service)

## Merge multiple PDF files into one

This small web app merges PDF files (think multiple page scans into one file) using a simple Linux command.
A service based on this code is running [here](https://pdf-merger-unite-nmv4siw5tq-ew.a.run.app/). Don't judge the HTML.

In contrast with other services available online to merge multiple PDF files into one, this solution can be used as a regular Spring Boot app, a standalone Docker image, or better yet, deployed to [Cloud Run](cloud.run). The application can be improved in many ways such as on UI/UX front (see the [Contributing](#a-word-on-contributing) section below). It should also not be too hard for folks to adapt the code to turn this into a headless service instead of a web app.

If you'd like to make this available as a service for your friends and family or within your company to avoid sharing files with random online services, then deploying this container image to Cloud Run (see the [Getting started](#getting-started) section below) is an interesting option. You should also be able to deploy this to [Cloud Run on GKE](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/gke/setup) if you'd rather run on a different environment.

## Using pdfunite under the covers

The heavy lifting is done by executing `pdfunite`, a Linux command-line tool available [here](https://github.com/mtgrosser/pdfunite). Execution is implemented using `ProcessBuilder` and the presence of the binary is guaranteed by packaging the app into a continer using [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) together with a base image containing both `openjdk` and `pdfunite`.

## A word on privacy

This app uses only the container's local filesystem and deletes all files after the merged PDF document has been generated (or if the merge failed for some reason).
I am not interested in developing features to store any data in file storage services of any kind for this application.

## Getting started, the easy way

The easisest way to get started is probably to click this button and let it guide you :

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run)

## Getting started, the less easy way

Run locally (no docker involved) :

`$ mvn spring-boot:run`

Build and create a container image using [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) (using a base image which contains `openjdk11` and the `pdfunite` binary):

`$ mvn compile jib:build -Dimage=<your image, eg. gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/pdfmerger>`

Run locally using Docker :

`$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -t gcr.io/${PROJECT-ID}/pdfmerger`

Deploy to Cloud Run using this command (or use the [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)) :

`$ gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/${PROJECT-ID}/pdfmerger --platform managed --allow-unauthenticated --memory=1024Mi `

You can also deploy this pre-built public image: `gcr.io/alexismp-pdfmerger/pdfmerger-unite`

## A word on concurrency

Concurrency can be hard. The implementation in this repository accounts for Cloud Run's built-in [concurrency](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency) to make sure multiple users don't end up mixing their files (ugh!) since they share the same filesystem. Files for every given user are grouped with a common prefix and their order is preserved in a List.

You could use a somewhat simpler implementation and set the concurrency of Cloud Run to 1, essentially mimicking what FaaS products usually do, but this would likely increase the number of cold starts and thus worsen the user experience.

## A word on contributing

Please follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Forking is great too!

Yes, the UI is crap and the UX is just as bad. Some improvement ideas include :
* manipulate an arbitrary number of files (selecting multiple files in a single input doesn't help with order). The backend is not written for a hard-coded number of files.
* re-order files before uploading them (in which case a single input for mutiple files could work)
* provide an upload tracker for large files
* preview files before they're uploaded
* client-side testing that the files actually contain PDF (server-side testing is implemented)
